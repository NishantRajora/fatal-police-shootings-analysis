# 🚔 Fatal Police Shootings Data Analysis

This repository contains a **data analysis project** on fatal police shootings in the United States, using the dataset from the *Washington Post* and related sources.  
The project focuses on **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **visualization** of key patterns such as demographics, geographic distribution, weapon status, and temporal trends.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Demographics**: Clear trends in **age, gender, and race** distribution of victims.  
- **Geography**: Certain states contribute **disproportionately** to fatal shootings.  
- **Body Cameras**: Usage has **increased over years**, but adoption varies across states.  
- **Weapons**: Being armed vs. unarmed significantly impacts frequency & reporting.  
- **Temporal Trends**: Both **seasonal** and **yearly fluctuations** are visible.

## 🌍 Visualizations

Some sample outputs (see `/visuals` for all):

- Age distribution of victims  
- Body camera usage pie chart  
- Heatmap of top states  
- Interactive incident map (**map.html**)

## 📌 Future Work

- ✅ Add **machine learning models** for predictive analysis  
- ✅ Perform **clustering of states/incidents** by patterns  
- ✅ Automate **data preprocessing pipeline**  
- ✅ Deploy an **interactive dashboard** (e.g., Streamlit, Plotly Dash)

## ⚡ Tech Stack

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium)  
- **Jupyter / Scripts** for analysis  
- **MS Word / Docs** for reporting  
- **GitHub** for version control & sharing
